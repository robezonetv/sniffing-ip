# sniffing-ips
Here is updated list of all IP addresses, which sniffing on my server on unstandard SSH port.

## How often it's updated?
I check my firewall every hour, and if i found new IP, add it to this repository.

## Found your IP in list?
If yes, please check your device, if it's not part of some botnet or something like that. Or stop sniffing my server. :)
